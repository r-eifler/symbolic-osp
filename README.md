# Symbolic Top-k Planner
Sym-k is a state-of-the-art top-k planner. The objective of top-k planning is to determine a set of k different plans with lowest cost for a given planning task.

## Dependencies
Currently we only support Linux systems. The following should install all necessary dependencies.
```console
$ sudo apt-get -y install cmake g++ make python autotools-dev automake gcc g++-multilib
```
 
## Compiling the Top-k Planner

```console
$ ./buildy.py 
```

## Configurations

We recommend to use the following configuration which uses bidirectional search and 
reports the best **k** plans.

```console
$ ./fast-downward.py domain.pddl problem.pddl --search "symk-bd(plan_selection=top_k(num_plans=**k**))"
```

Other configurations are as follows.

 
```console
# Forward Search
$ ./fast-downward.py domain.pddl problem.pddl --search "symk-fw(plan_selection=top_k(num_plans=**k**))"


# Backward Search
$ ./fast-downward.py domain.pddl problem.pddl --search "symk-bw(plan_selection=top_k(num_plans=**k**))"
```

## Generate-and-Test Plans Framework

It is possible to create plans until a plan is found that meets complex requirements.
For this purpose it is possible to write your own plan selector. During the search, plans are created and handed over to a plan selector with an anytime behavior. 
Two examples of plan selectors are the [ top_k_selector](src/search/symbolic/plan_selection/top_k_selector.cc) and
the [top_k_even_selector](src/search/symbolic/plan_selection/top_k_even_selector.cc).
The most important function is *add_plan*, in which you can specify whether a newly generated plan shall be accepted or rejected.
To create your own plan selector, you can copy the *.cc* and *.h* files of one of these two selectors and adjust them accordingly. Also add the new file name to [DownwardFiles.cmake](src/search/DownwardFiles.cmake), similar to the other selection files.
Finally, if you want to find a plan with your *awesome_selector* selector (the name of the selector you specified for the plugin in the *.cc* file), you can use the following command. 

```console
$ ./fast-downward.py domain.pddl problem.pddl --search "symk-bd(plan_selection=awesome_selector(num_plans=1))"
```

Note, that you can also search for the best **k** plans using your selector.
